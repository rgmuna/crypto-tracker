# Cryto Tracker

A cryptocurrency tracking web app that allows users to store their cryptocurrency transactions and display them in an informative fashion. Project was developed out of a need for a specific way of displaying my crypto coins, in particular showing the total amount spent versus the current worth of the portfolio and how each subsequent transaction is performing. Adding Google login authentication so that anyone can use the web app to store their credentials and their transactions.
